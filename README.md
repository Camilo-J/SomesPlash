# SOMESPLASH
## Description

Welcome aboard fellow developer, this project is about  an open source platforms to share amazing photos with the world.

This project was built only with the design of the main views [here](https://www.figma.com/file/UqSMl0f43mV6yqguK6IrVR/Somesplash?node-id=888%3A708). My Team and me had to infer many details based on the design to develop this design. 

 ## Project's Erd
   This is the ERD that we achieved to build with the design in Figma and infering many details.
